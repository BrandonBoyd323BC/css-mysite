            <h2>Hello.</h2>
            <p class="center-text"> I used to be on the Administrative side of IT but after building a website I knew I had to change. I am far better and more interested in development than any other aspect of the business so far.

                <h3>Why I am Capable</h3>
                <p>After getting introduced to php framework codeigniter, drawing on the basic web development principles I had learned prior, and Google, I made the site in about 3 months. This time frame included a lot of changes that management wanted to implement to make the site look more appealing.I carried it on my own from local host using IIS, to running live on the old host web.com, to transferring the site to Siteground. I was able to style the site with a custom images that I made using Photoshop while taking full advantage of favicons, templates and Bootstrap. I placed APIs on the location pages that link to Google Maps and added little touches while keeping the site mobile ready. I was enthusiastic to work on it everyday and pleased to point at what I had done.</p>

                <h3>What Have I Done Lately</h3>
                <p>I understanding that one needs more than on site to change career fields so I decided to get training in the same way I learned the first time. I have done Udemy courses to learn fundamentals and best practices ads well as getting better at vanilla javascript. I have built things like this and learned to use GitHub a better alternative than keeping various sets of folders.</p>
